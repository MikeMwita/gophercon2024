# Contributing to Gophercon Africa Nairobi

Thank you for showing interest to contribute to Gophercon Africa Nairobi. It means so much. The Go community benefits from these contributions!

## House Rules

- Before contributing, please check if it already exists in issues or PRs
- Given the speed at which we're moving on the codebase, we don't assign issues or "give" issues to anyone, feel free to work on feature and/or bug and 
  create a PR.
- When multiple PRs are submitted for the same issue, we take the one that most succinctly & efficiently solves a given problem and stays within the scope of work.
- Priority is generally given to previous committers as they've proven familiarity with the codebase and product.
- The timeline for this project is one week and we will minimize hand-holding.
